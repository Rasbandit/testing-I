# Objectives

## Using `test` global

* Student can write a unit test using `test` global.

## Using Jest matchers

* Student can use `expect` method for assertions.
* Student can use `toBe` matcher to test with strict equality
* Student can use `toEqual` matcher to recursively check every field of an object or an array
* Student can use `toContain` matcher to check if array contains specific item
* Student can use, or knows how to find (docs), other common matchers
    * Numbers:
        * .toBeGreaterThan()
        * .toBeGreaterThanOrEqual()
        * .toBeLessThan()
        * .toBeLessThanOrEqual()
    * Others:
        * .not
        * .toBeNull()
        * .toBeUndefined()
        * .toBeDefined()
        * .toBeTruthy()
        * .toBeFalsy()

## Grouping tests together
* Student can use `describe` global to group tests together.

## Skip/Only
* Student can skip an individual test or a block of tests with `.skip()`
* Student can run only one test (only) or block of tests (only) at a time using `.only()`

## Testing async functions
* Student can write test for asynchronous function using async/await
* Student can write test for asynchronous function by using return statement to return promise object

## Setup/teardown
* Student can use beforeAll() for one-time setup for tests/block of tests
* Student can use afterAll() for teardown after tests/block of tests
* Student can use beforeEach() to setup for each test/test within a block
* Student can use afterEach() for teardown after each test/test within a block
